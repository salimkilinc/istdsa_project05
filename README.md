I have successfully concluded the Data Science Bootcamp at the Istanbul Data Science Academy. And now, I am pleased to present my capstone project.

The world of data science offers endless opportunities for innovative projects, and one that particularly piques my interest is developing a recommender system. By combining statistical algorithms with real-world applications, this endeavor is both challenging and exciting. For my latest project, I am embarking on a journey to create a 'Wine Recommender' System, utilizing a hybrid approach that combines both Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering techniques. The datasets I will be using are the widely recognized [X-Wines](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/7/1/20) datasets, which include both the wines.csv and ratings.csv files.

You can explore the entire analysis by reviewing the project files, or you can refer to my [Medium article](https://medium.com/@salimkilinc/data-science-capstone-project-building-a-recommender-system-39733bfaa044) for detailed explanations. 

You can also utilize the model I developed in this project through the [Streamlit application](https://xwines.streamlit.app)
